So it logs the same sorts of information as the Web Console - network requests, JavaScript, CSS, and security errors and warnings, and messages explicitly logged by JavaScript code. You can open console by right clicking on blank space of any website and click on inspect and on the top you will see a list with many options there click on console</p>
